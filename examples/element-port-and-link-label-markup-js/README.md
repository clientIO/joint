# JointJS: Element, Port and Link Label Markup

You probably know that you can style your JointJS elements in many different ways by providing your own SVG markup. But did you know that you can use the same custom markup not only to define elements but also ports or link labels? Have a look at this example.

## Install

From the root of the monorepo, install all dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
yarn run build
````

## Development

Run the development server from this example directory:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Then open the URL printed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Build

Create a production build:

```bash
yarn build
```

The output will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

## Preview

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
yarn preview
```
