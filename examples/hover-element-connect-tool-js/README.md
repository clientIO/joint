# JointJS: Hover Element Connect Tool

Need to create links from elements in a drag & drop fashion, but only show the connect tool when a user hovers an element path? When the user hovers an invisible track path on an element, the tool appears at the point where the user moves the mouse.

## Install

From the root of the monorepo, install all dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
yarn run build
````

## Development

Run the development server from this example directory:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Then open the URL printed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Build

Create a production build:

```bash
yarn build
```

The output will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

## Preview

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
yarn preview
```
