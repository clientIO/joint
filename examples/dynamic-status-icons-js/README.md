# JointJS: Dynamic Status Icons

Need to indicate a particular status dynamically? When working with highlighters, we can add a list of arbitrary SVG elements to the cell view, and then update this list in the manner we want.

## Install

From the root of the monorepo, install all dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
yarn run build
````

## Development

Run the development server from this example directory:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Then open the URL printed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Build

Create a production build:

```bash
yarn build
```

The output will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

## Preview

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
yarn preview
```
