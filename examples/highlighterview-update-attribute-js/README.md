# JointJS: HighlighterView Update Attribute

Need to update the appearance of a highlighter based on some input value? In the following demo, the highlighter is updated any time the range input value is adjusted. The available stock is displayed as a number. When no stock is available, more unique attributes are displayed.

## Install

The output will be generated in the `dist/` directory.
