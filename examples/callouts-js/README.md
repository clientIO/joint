# JointJS: Callouts

Do you want to annotate diagram elements with various callouts (rectangle or oval balloon, thought, brace) but not sure how to implement them? Check out this demo.

## Install

From the root of the monorepo, install all dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
yarn run build
````

## Development

Run the development server from this example directory:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Then open the URL printed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Build

Create a production build:

```bash
yarn build
```

The output will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

## Preview

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
yarn preview
```
