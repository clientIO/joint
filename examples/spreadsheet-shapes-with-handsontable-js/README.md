# JointJS: Spreadsheet Shapes with Handsontable

In the demo below, we reveal how we've integrated the Handsontable third-party spreadsheet library with JointJS. It includes the insertion of a table into a JointJS shape using a custom element view, aligning ports to the center of the columns, and introducing the concept of mapping with transformation functions between two separate tables.

The output will be generated in the `dist/` directory.
