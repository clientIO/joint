# JointJS: Absolute Port Layout & Dynamic Port Sizes

Do you need the size of element ports to be driven by the text they contain? Do you want to position ports based on dynamic factors? This demo shows exactly that.

## Install

From the root of the monorepo, install all dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
yarn run build
````

## Development

Run the development server from this example directory:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Then open the URL printed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Build

Create a production build:

```bash
yarn build
```

The output will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

## Preview

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
yarn preview
```
