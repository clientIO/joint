# JointJS: Scale Option For Tools

Need to scale element or link tools up or down in an easy manner? Using the scale option available with tools, you can achieve just that. The default level is 1, so just adjust the value to find something which visually suits your application.

## Install

From the root of the monorepo, install all dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
yarn run build
````

## Development

Run the development server from this example directory:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Then open the URL printed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Build

Create a production build:

```bash
yarn build
```

The output will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

## Preview

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
yarn preview
```
