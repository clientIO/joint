# JointJS: Fault Tree Analysis

This demo is an excellent example of a diagramming studio using JointJS, our open-source diagramming library. Fault Tree Analysis is a technique to conduct a root cause analysis and is a useful tool for companies to diagnose a problem. The Fault Tree Diagram is a visual representation of such analysis and makes establishing the diagnosis easier.
