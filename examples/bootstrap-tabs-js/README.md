# JointJS: Bootstrap Tabs

Need to create multiple Bootstrap Tabs while displaying and manipulating diagram content? The following demo shows how to integrate Bootstrap Tabs with JointJS. The first tab displays a button for translating a JointJS element, and this translation is reflected in the diagram on the second tab.

## Install

From the root of the monorepo, install all dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
yarn run build
````

## Development

Run the development server from this example directory:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Then open the URL printed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Build

Create a production build:

```bash
yarn build
```

The output will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

## Preview

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
yarn preview
```
