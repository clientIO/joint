# JointJS: Dynamic Font Size

Do you need font-size to be dynamic, and adjust according to another factor such as element height? The following demo shows you how to achieve that. Taking advantage of the calc() function, users can easily adjust font-size of an element according to its height.

## Install

From the root of the monorepo, install all dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
yarn run build
````

## Development

Run the development server from this example directory:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Then open the URL printed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Build

Create a production build:

```bash
yarn build
```

The output will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

## Preview

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
yarn preview
```
