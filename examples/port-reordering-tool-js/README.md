# JointJS: Port Reordering Tool

Need to support user interactions that are not part of JointJS? For example, allowing users to drag and drop ports and change their order? This can be accomplished using the custom element tool, as we have done in this demo.

## Install

From the root of the monorepo, install all dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
yarn run build
````

## Development

Run the development server from this example directory:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Then open the URL printed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Build

Create a production build:

```bash
yarn build
```

The output will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

## Preview

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
yarn preview
```
