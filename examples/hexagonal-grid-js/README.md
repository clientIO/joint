# JointJS: Hexagonal Grid

How would you create a hexagonal grid diagram? We used the Honeycomb library to do the math for us, and JointJS, which rendered the grid and the shapes in it and made everything interactive. Check out the result below.

## Install

From the root of the monorepo, install all dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
yarn run build
````

## Development

Run the development server from this example directory:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Then open the URL printed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Build

Create a production build:

```bash
yarn build
```

The output will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

## Preview

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
yarn preview
```
