# vue-jointjs

A Vue.js 2 with JointJS v3 project

## Project setup
```sh

It will run on port 8080 by default. If that port is already in use, the next free port will be used.

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Compiles and minifies for production
```sh
npm run build
```

## Lint source code
```sh
npm run lint
```

## Clean both development and build folders
```sh
npm run clean
```
