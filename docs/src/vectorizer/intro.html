<p>JointJS exports three global variables, the <code>joint</code> namespace, the <b><code>V</code></b> variable and the <b><code>g</code></b> variable (that is described later in the <a href="geometry.html">Geometry</a> section). The <code>V</code> variable is a function of a little SVG helper library that we call <q>Vectorizer</q>. The reason why this library sits in its own namespace and not inside the <code>joint</code> namespace is that it can be used completely standalone, even without JointJS. It is a very helpful library making life easier when dealing with SVG. You can think of it as of a very lightweight jQuery for SVG. If you want to use Vectorizer as a standalone library, see the download page that contains both the <b><a href="http://jointjs.com/download#vectorizer">development and minified versions</a></b>.</p>
