        <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector">Normalize</a> the point vector and return the point itself. In other words, 
            scale the line segment between (0, 0) and the point in order for it to have a length of <code>len</code>. 
            If len is not specified, it is considered to be <code>1</code> in which case a unit vector is computed.</p>
