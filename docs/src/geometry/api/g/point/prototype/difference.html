        <p>Return a point that has coordinates computed as a difference between the point and another point with coordinates <code>dx</code> and <code>dy</code>. If only 
        <code>dx</code> is specified and is a number, <code>dy</code> is considered to be zero. If only <code>dx</code> is specified and is an object,
        it is considered to be another point or an object in the form <code>{ x: [number], y: [number] }</code></p>
