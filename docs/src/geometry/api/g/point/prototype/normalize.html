<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector">Normalize</a> the point vector and return the point itself.</p>

<p>In other words, scale the line segment between (0, 0) and the point in order for it to have the given <code>length</code>. If length is not specified, it is considered to be <code>1</code>; in that case, a unit vector is computed.</p>
