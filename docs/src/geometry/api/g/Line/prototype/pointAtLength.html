<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>line.pointAtLength(length)</code></pre>
<p>Return a point on the line that lies <code>length</code> away from the beginning of the line.</p>

<p>If negative <code>length</code> is provided, the algorithm starts looking from the end of the curve. If <code>length</code> is higher than curve length, the closest line endpoint is returned instead.</p>
