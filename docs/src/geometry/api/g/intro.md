Together with [Vectorizer](vectorizer.html), Geometry is another lightweight library built-in to JointJS. This library implements many useful **geometry operations**. The geometry library does not have any dependencies and can be used standalone. Please see the download page that contains both the [development and minified versions](http://jointjs.com/download#geometry) of this library.
