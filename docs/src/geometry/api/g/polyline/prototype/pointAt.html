<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>polyline.pointAt(ratio)</code></pre>
<p>Return a point on the polyline that lies <code>ratio</code> (normalized length) away from the beginning of the polyline.</p>

<p>The function expects <code>ratio</code> to lie between 0 and 1; values outside the range are constrained to 0 and 1, respectively. If the polyline contains no points, <code>null</code> is returned.</p>
