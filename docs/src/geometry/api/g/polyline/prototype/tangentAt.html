<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>polyline.tangentAt(ratio)</code></pre>
<p>Return a line tangent to the polyline at point that lies <code>ratio</code> (normalized length) away from the beginning of the polyline.</p>

<p>The function expects <code>ratio</code> to lie between 0 and 1; values outside the range are constrained to 0 and 1, respectively. If point at <code>ratio</code> is a point of discontinuity (e.g. it is a point shared by two polyline segments with different slopes), the tangent line is constructed for the earlier segment (i.e. the segment closer to the beginning of the polyline). If the polyline contains no points, <code>null</code> is returned.</p>
