<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>polyline.tangentAtLength(length)</code></pre>
<p>Return a line tangent to the polyline at point that lies <code>length</code> away from the beginning of the polyline.</p>

<p>If negative <code>length</code> is provided, the algorithm starts looking from the end of the polyline. If <code>length</code> is higher than the length of the polyline, a line tangent to the closest valid polyline endpoint is returned instead. If point at <code>length</code> is a point of discontinuity (e.g. it is a point shared by two polyline segments with different slopes), the tangent line is constructed for the earlier segment (i.e. the segment closer to the beginning of the polyline). If the polyline contains no points, <code>null</code> is returned.</p>
