<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>line.pointAtLength(length)</code></pre>
<p>Return a point on the line that lies <code>length</code> away from the beginning of the line.</p>

<p>If the <code>length</code> requested does not lie on the curve (either because it is smaller than 0 or because it is higher than line length), the closest line endpoint is returned instead.</p>
