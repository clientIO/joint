<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>line.tangentAtLength(length)</code></pre>
<p>Return a line tangent to the line at point that lies <code>length</code> away from the beginning of the line.</p>

<p>If the <code>length</code> requested does not lie on the path (either because it is smaller than 0 or because it is higher than line length), a line tangent to the closest line endpoint is returned instead.</p>

<p>The tangent line starts at the specified point. The direction from <code>start</code> to <code>end</code> is the same as the direction of the line at the specified point. If the two endpoints of the line both lie at the same coordinates, <code>null</code> is returned (it is impossible to determine the slope of a point).</p>
