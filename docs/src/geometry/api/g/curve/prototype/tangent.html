<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>curve.tangent(t)</code></pre>
<p>Return a line that is tangent to the curve at given <code>t</code>.</p>

<p>The direction from <code>start</code> to <code>end</code> is the same as the direction of the curve at <code>t</code>. If the control points of the provided curve all lie at the same coordinates, <code>null</code> is returned (it is impossible to determine the slope of a point).</p>
