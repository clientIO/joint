<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>point.vectorAngle(p)</code></pre>
<p>Compute the angle (in degrees) between the line from (0,0) and this point and the line from (0,0) to <code>p</code>.</p>

<p>The function returns a value between 0 and 180 when the angle (in the direction from this point to <code>p</code>) is clockwise, and a value between 180 and 360 when the angle is counterclockwise. The function returns <code>NaN</code> if called from point (0,0) or if <code>p</code> is (0,0).</p>
