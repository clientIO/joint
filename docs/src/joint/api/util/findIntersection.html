<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>util.findIntersection(node, ref)</code></pre><p>
          Find the intersection of a line starting in the center
          of the SVG <code>node</code> ending in the point <code>ref</code>.
          The function uses <code>isPointInStroke()</code> and <code>isPointInFill()</code> methods that are
          not supported by all the browsers. However, a fallback
          that finds the intersection of only the bounding box is provided in those cases.
          Returns <code>undefined</code> if no intersection is found.
