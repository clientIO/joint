<p>The <code>TargetAnchor</code> link tool renders a handle above the target anchor of the link (as determined by the <a href="#dia.Link.presentation.anchor">anchor function</a> applied on <a href="#dia.Link.presentation.target">link target</a>). It accepts five additional arguments, which can be passed as an object to the link tool constructor:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>redundancyRemoval</th>
        <td><i>boolean</i></td>
        <td>If the user moves the anchor so that it lies on a single line with two (or more) vertices, should the middle one(s) be considered redundant and removed? Default is <code>true</code>. Note that this setting is not applied until the user actually moves the anchor; this means that the anchor and vertices can still be arranged in this <q>redundant</q> fashion, using the <code>link.vertices</code> <a href="#dia.Link.prototype.vertices">function</a>, for example.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>restrictArea</th>
        <td><i>boolean</i></td>
        <td>Should the user only be allowed to move the anchor in a restricted area (the area of the bounding box of the target magnet)? Default is <code>true</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>areaPadding</th>
        <td><i>number</i></td>
        <td>If the <code>restrictArea</code> option is set to <code>true</code>, the user can only move the anchor in a restricted area (the area of the bounding box of the target magnet). JointJS shows this restriction by drawing a boundary around that area. This option determines whether this boundary area should be visually inflated and if so, by how much. Default is <code>10</code>. Note that this is a purely cosmetic setting; regardless of the provided value, the movement stays restricted to the original uninflated bounding box.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>snap</th>
        <td><i>function</i></td>
        <td>What snap function should be applied when the user moves the anchor? Default is a simple function that emulates the snapping behavior of <a href="#linkTools.Vertices">Vertices</a> and <a href="#linkTools.Segments">Segments</a> link tools: If one of the user pointer coordinates are within <code>snapRadius</code> of a coordinate of the anchor reference, snap to that coordinate. (For link target, the anchor reference is the last vertex. If there are no vertices, it is the source anchor.)<br><br>

            The callback function must return the anchor as a <code>g.Point</code> and have the signature <code>function(coords, view, magnet)</code>:</p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>coords</th>
                    <td><i>g.Point</i></td>
                    <td>A Point object recording the x-y coordinates of the user pointer when the snap function was invoked.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>view</th>
                    <td><i>dia.ElementView</i></td>
                    <td>The ElementView which contains the restricted area. The Element model can be accessed as the <code>model</code> property; this may be useful for writing conditional logic based on element attributes.</td>

                    <th>magnet</th>

    <tr>

        <td><i>number</i></td>
        <td>While the user is moving the anchor, from how far away should the segment snap in order to arrange itself in line with the anchor reference? Default is <code>10</code>. (For link target, the anchor reference is the last vertex. If there are no vertices, it is the source anchor.)</td>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>var targetAnchorTool = new joint.linkTools.TargetAnchor({
    focusOpacity: 0.5,
    redundancyRemoval: false,
    restrictArea: false,
    snapRadius: 20
});</code></pre>

<p>An example of a useful custom <code>snap</code> function is provided below. It snaps the anchor to the center of the closest side of the restricted area.</p>

<pre><code>var snapAnchor = function(coords, view, magnet) {

    // remove rotation of the restricted area
    var bbox = view.getNodeUnrotatedBBox(magnet);
    var angle = view.model.angle();
    var origin = view.model.getBBox().center();
    coords.rotate(origin, angle);

    // identify the side nearest to pointer coords
    var anchor;
    var side = bbox.sideNearestToPoint(coords);
    switch (side) {
        case 'left': anchor = bbox.leftMiddle(); break;
        case 'right': anchor = bbox.rightMiddle(); break;
        case 'top': anchor = bbox.topMiddle(); break;
        case 'bottom': anchor = bbox.bottomMiddle(); break;
    }

    // rotate the anchor according to original rotation of restricted area
    return anchor.rotate(origin, -angle);
};

car targetAnchorTool = new joint.linkTools.TargetAnchor({
    snap: snapAnchor;
});</code></pre>

<p>If the user moves the anchor away from its original position, the anchor position may be reset by double-clicking the anchor handle.</p>
