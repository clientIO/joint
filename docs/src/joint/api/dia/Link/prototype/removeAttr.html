<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>link.removeAttr(path, [options])</code></pre><p>Remove a previously set attribute from the link. <code>path</code> can either be a string that specifies
          the path to the, possibly nested, attribute to be removed or an array of more paths.
          The associated link view makes sure the link gets re-rendered properly.
          If <code>options</code> is passed, it can contain data that is passed over to 
          the event listeners for the <code>change:attrs</code> event triggered on the link
          itself and also on the graph the link is in.
