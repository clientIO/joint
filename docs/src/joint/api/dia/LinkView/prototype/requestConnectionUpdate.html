<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>linkView.requestConnectionUpdate()</code></pre>
<p>Schedule an update of the connection (anchors, connection points, route and connector) of this link view in the next animation frame (for paper <code>async</code> mode) or run immediately (for paper <code>sync</code> mode). Useful for links with an automatic router (such as <code>manhattan</code>) if the route has to be recalculated due to another element in the graph changing its position.</p>
