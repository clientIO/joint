Only one tool can be focused at a time; the focus passes to the last tool within this tools view with which the <code>focusTool</code> function was called.</p>

<p>The effect of this function can be reversed by the <code>toolsView.blurTool</code> <a href="#dia.ToolsView.prototype.blurTool">function</a>.</p>
