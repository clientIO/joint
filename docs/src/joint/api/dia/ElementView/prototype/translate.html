<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>elementView.translate()</code></pre>
<p>
    This method makes sure the element view position matches the the underlying model position.
    It's invoked once on render and every time the model's <code>position</code> attribute is changed (<code>change:position</code> event is triggered).
