<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>elementView.update()</code></pre>
<p>
    This method makes sure the underlying model's presentation attributes are set on the element view.
    It's invoked once on render and every time the model's <code>attrs</code> attribute is changed (<code>change:attrs</code> event is triggered).
