<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>elementView.rotate()</code></pre>
<p>
    This method makes sure the element view (specifically the <code>rotatable</code> group) is rotated by the same angle as the underlying model.
    It's invoked once on render and every time the model's <code>angle</code> attribute is changed (<code>change:angle</code> event is triggered).
