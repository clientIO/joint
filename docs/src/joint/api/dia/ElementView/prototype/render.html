<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>elementView.render()</code></pre>
<p>
    The method renders the markup, updates the presentation attributes and resizes, rotates and translates the view.
    This method is invoked when the element view is added to the paper and also when the <code>attrs</code> attribute is changed together with the <code>dirty</code> flag being passed along.
    <pre><code>// Render is called here when the graph is connected to a paper.
model.addTo(graph);
// Causing the element view to re-render itself.
model.attr('rect/fill', 'red', { dirty: true })</code></pre>
</p>
