<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>elementView.resize()</code></pre>
<p>
    This method makes sure the element view (specifically the <code>scalable</code> group) is scaled to match the the underlying model size.
    It's invoked once on render and every time the model's <code>size</code> attribute is changed (<code>change:size</code> event is triggered).
