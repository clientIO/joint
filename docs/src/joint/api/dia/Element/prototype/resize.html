<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>element.resize(width, height [, opt])</code></pre><p>Resize an element in place so that the <a href="http://jointjs.com/tutorial/custom-elements">&quot;scalable&quot; group</a> has width <code>width</code> and height <code>height</code>. In place in this case means
            that the top-left corner of the element stays at the same position after resizing. In other words,
          the element is streched to the bottom/right (by default). To change the direction of resizing, set
          <code>opt.direction</code> to one of <code>'left'</code>, <code>'right'</code>, <code>'top'</code>, <code>'bottom'</code>,
          <code>'top-right'</code>, <code>'top-left'</code>, <code>'bottom-left'</code> or <code>'bottom-right'</code> (the default).
        </p><p>There is a difference between a classical scale and 
            <a href="#dia.Element.prototype.resize">resize</a> operations. <code>resize</code> doesn't actually scale the whole SVG <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> element grouping
            all its subelements. It only scales subelements of the <code data-lang="svg">&lt;g class&quot;scalable&quot;/&gt;</code> group. This is very
            useful and brings a lot of flexibility in defining which subelements should be scaled and which not. Imagine a simple
            rectangle element with text inside. Usually, when we resize the whole element, we expect the rectangle to 
            get scaled while the text should stay the same size, only its position should be adjusted so that the text stays
            in the center of the rectangle. This can be easilly achieved by adding the <code>&lt;rect/&gt;</code> element to the <code data-lang="svg">&lt;g class&quot;scalable&quot;/&gt;</code> group 
            in the markup and positioning the text 
            subelement relatively to the <code>&lt;rect /&gt;</code> element: <code data-lang="svg">&lt;text ref-x=&quot;.5&quot; ref-y=&quot;.5&quot; ref=&quot;rect&quot; /&gt;</code>.
            Note that neither of <code>ref-x, ref-y and ref</code> attributes is an SVG standard attribute. These are special 
            attributes introduced by JointJS. More on these in the section on <a href="#SpecialAttributes">Special attributes</a>.</p>
