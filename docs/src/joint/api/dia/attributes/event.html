<p>
The <code>event</code> attribute makes the selected node and its descendants trigger an arbitrary event when clicked (mousedown/touchstart).
This event is triggered on the view itself and the paper.
The paper handler is called with the signature <code>cellView</code>, <code>evt</code>, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>,
while the cell view handler is called only with <code>evt</code>, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>.
</p>

<pre><code>element.attr({
  image: {
    // pointerdown on the image SVG node will trigger the `element:delete` event
    event: 'element:delete',
    xlinkHref: 'trash.png'
    width: 20,
    height: 20
  }
});
// Binding handler to the event
paper.on('element:delete', function(elementView, evt) {
  // Stop any further actions with the element view e.g. dragging
  evt.stopPropagation();
  if (confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this element?')) {
      elementView.model.remove();
  }
});</code></pre>
