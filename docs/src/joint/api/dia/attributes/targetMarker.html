<p>Valid for <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> subelements. The same as <a href="#dia.attributes.sourceMarker">sourceMarker</a> but draws an SVG element at the end of the path.
Note the coordinate system for drawing is rotated by 180 degrees for convenience (this allows to use the same marker for source and target and have them both face the connected elements).</p>
