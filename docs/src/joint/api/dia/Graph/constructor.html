  <code>joint.dia.Graph</code> is the model holding all cells (elements and links) of the diagram. It's a 
  <a href="https://backbonejs.org/#Model">Backbone model</a>. The collection of all the cells is stored in the property <b><code>cells</code></b>.
</p>

<p>
  The graph is a powerful data model behind all JointJS diagrams. It not only provides efficient storage for directed graphs, but also offers useful 
  algorithms for traversing the graphs.
</p>

<p>
  In order for JointJS to find the correct constructor for your cell, the <code>graph</code> option <code>cellNamespace</code> must be provided in 
  its constructor function when a graph is instantiated. Built-in shapes are usually located in the <code>joint.shapes</code> namespace, so this is 
  a common namespace to use. It's possible to add custom shapes to this namespace, or alternatively, you may like to use a different namespace 
  completely.
</p>

<p>
  For example, if <code>joint.shapes</code> is provided as the value of <code>cellNamespace</code>, and a cell is of type <code>'custom.Element'</code>,
  then the graph looks up the <code>joint.shapes.custom.Element</code> model when deserializing a graph from JSON format. If the graph is instantiated
  as e.g. <code>const graph = new joint.dia.Graph({}, { cellNamespace: myCustomNamespace })</code>, then the <code>graph</code> will read the model
  definition from the <code>myCustomNamespace.custom.Element</code> object instead. This option is often used in combination with the
  <code>cellViewNamespace</code> option on the <a href="#dia.Paper.prototype.options.cellViewNamespace">joint.dia.Paper</a> object.
