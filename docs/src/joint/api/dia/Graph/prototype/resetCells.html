<p>Reset cells in the graph. Update all the cells in the graph in one bulk. This is a more efficient method of adding cells to the graph if you ou want to replace all the cells in one go. <code>options</code> object can optionally contain additional data that is passed over to the event listeners of the graph reset event.</p>
