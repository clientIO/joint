<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>graph.getNeighbors(element [, opt])</code></pre>
<p>Get all the neighbors of <code>element</code> in the graph. Neighbors are all the elements connected to <code>element</code> via either an inbound or an outbound link.</p>

<p>Accepts several options, which may be provided inside an <code>opt</code> object:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>deep</code> - also return all the neighbors of all the elements embedded inside <code>element</code>.</li>
	<li><code>inbound</code> - return only inbound neighbors (neighbors connected with a link whose <code>target</code> is the <code>element</code>).</li>
	<li><code>outbound</code> - return only outbound neighbors (neighbors connected with a link whose <code>source</code> is the <code>element</code>).</li>
	<li><code>indirect</code> - in addition to standard rules (including <code>deep</code>/<code>outbound</code>/<code>inbound</code> modifications), also return the elements that can only be considered neighbors of <code>element</code> if we go <q>against the flow</q> of directed links at link-link connections.</li>
</ul>
