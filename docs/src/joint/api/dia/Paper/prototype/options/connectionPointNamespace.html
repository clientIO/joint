<code>connectionPointNamespace</code> - built-in <a href="#connectionPoints">connectionPoints</a> are defined by default on the 
                                        <code>joint.connectionPoints</code> namespace. It is also possible to define custom connectionPoints
                                        on this namespace. If you would like JointJS to look for connectionPoint definitions under a different 
                                        namespace, you can set the <code>connectionPointNamespace</code> option to your desired 
                                        namespace.
