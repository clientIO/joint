<code>frontParentOnly</code> - when set to the default <code>true</code>, only the element at the very front is taken into account for 
embedding. If disabled, the elements under the dragged view are tested one by one (from front to back) until a valid parent is found.

<pre><code>
    // If a child element is embedded and covers the area of 'app.Container', a third element is unable to be embedded
    validateEmbedding: function(childView, parentView) {
        const model = parentView.model;
        if (model.get('type') === 'app.Container') return true;
        return false;
    },
    frontParentOnly: true,
</code></pre>
