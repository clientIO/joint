<code>interactive</code> - if set to <code>false</code>, interaction with elements and links is disabled. If it is a function, it will be called with the cell view in action and the name of the method it is evaluated in (<code>'pointerdown'</code>, <code>'pointermove'</code>, ...). If the returned value of 
                  such a function is <code>false</code> interaction will be disabled for the action. For links, there are special properties of the <code>interaction</code> object that are useful to disable the default behaviour. These
                  properties are: <code>vertexAdd</code>, <code>vertexMove</code>, <code>vertexRemove</code> and <code>arrowheadMove</code>. By setting any of these properties to <code>false</code>, you can disable the related default action on links.
