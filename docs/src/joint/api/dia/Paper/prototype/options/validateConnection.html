<code>validateConnection(cellViewS, magnetS, cellViewT, magnetT, end, linkView)</code> - 
a function that allows you control which link connections can be made between the source cellView/magnet (<code>cellViewS/magnetS</code>), and the target cellView/magnet (<code>cellViewT/magnetT</code>). 
<code>end</code> is either the <code>&quot;source&quot;</code> or the <code>&quot;target&quot;</code>, and indicates which end of the link is being dragged. 
This is useful for defining whether a link starting in port <i>POut</i> of element A can lead to port <i>PIn</i> of element B. By default, all connections are allowed.

<pre><code>// The following would mean a link is not allowed connect to itself

validateConnection: function(cellViewS, magnetS, cellViewT, magnetT) {
    return magnetS !== magnetT;
}  
</code></pre>
