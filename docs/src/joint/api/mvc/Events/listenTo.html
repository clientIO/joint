<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>object.listenTo(other, event, callback)</code></pre>

<p>
    Tell an object to listen to a particular event on an 'other' object. <code>listenTo</code> allows the object to keep track of the events, and 
    they can be removed all at once later on. The callback will always be called with object as context. 
</p>

<pre><code>view.listenTo(model, 'change', view.render);
</code></pre>
