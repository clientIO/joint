<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>collection.at(index)</code></pre>

<p>
    Get a model from a collection, specified by index. Useful if your collection is sorted, and if your collection isn't sorted, <code>at</code> 
    will still retrieve models in insertion order. When passed a negative index, it will retrieve the model from the back of the collection.
