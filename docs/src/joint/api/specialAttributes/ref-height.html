        <p>Set height of the subelement relatively to the height of the element referenced to by the selector in <code>ref</code> attribute.
          If the value is in the <code>[0, 1]</code> interval (or expressed in percentages, e.g. <code>'80%'</code>), the height of the subelement will be set as a percentage
          of the height of the referenced element. If the value is <code>&lt;0</code> or <code>&gt;0</code>, the height
          of the subelement will be smaller/bigger than the height of the referenced element by the amount specified.
          Note that this makes sense only for SVG elements that support <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes, such
          as <code>&lt;rect&gt;</code>.
