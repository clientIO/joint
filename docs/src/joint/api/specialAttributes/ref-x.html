        <p>Make x-coordinate of the subelement relative to the x-coordinate of the element referenced to by the selector in <code>ref</code> attribute.
          If <code>ref-x</code> is in the <code>(0,1)</code> interval (or expressed in percentages, e.g. <code>'80%'</code>), the offset is
          calculated from the fraction of the bounding box of the referenced element. Otherwise, it is an absolute value in pixels.
        </p>
