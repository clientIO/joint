# Asking Technical Questions

*Please review the following guidelines in order to ask the best question possible.*

### 1. Summarize the problem as a title.

Open your question with a title/heading. This is the first thing potential answers will see. Think about your
problem carefully, and then try to summarize the problem in a short and clear manner.

These are some examples of helpful openings for a technical question.

- How can I ... ?
- Is it possible to ... ?
- Are there any ... ?
- Why do ... ?

If you're having trouble summarizing the problem, write the title last - sometimes writing the rest of the question first can make it easier to describe the problem.


### 2. Explain the problem.

Before providing some code examples, explain the problem in more detail in an opening paragraph. This should provide more context to the opening title. 


### 3. Include steps to reproduce problem.

Provide steps to reproduce the issue. Always include a minimal reproducible example if your question depends on code. It will allow others to reproduce the issue.

Try to format you code examples with sensible spacing, and follow popular conventions if possible.

**Note:** *Don't include screenshots of code examples. All code should be in code blocks/plain text which allows users to copy text easily, and to make it accessible for everyone. Please reserve the use of images for diagrams, demonstrating rendering bugs, etc.*

### 4. Include any restrictions.

If your project or question has any constraints or restrictions which means you can't use a particular solution, make sure to mention these limitations.

### 5. Share what you have tried.

Try to list what you have tried already. It will mean someone who helps you doesn't have to debug the problem from the very start.

Are you sure the answer can't be found in our documentation? You can find our [documentation](https://resources.jointjs.com) online.

### 6. English is hard. Proofread!

Writing in a foreign language is difficult. Once you have finished writing your problem, take some time to proofread and review. Is there anything about it you can improve? Pay attention to  spelling, grammar and punctuation.

Tools like [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) can automatically scan your text and advise on improving the grammar. It has extensions for all modern browsers.

Translators like [Deepl](https://www.deepl.com/translator) or [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) can also help you improve your questions.

### Extra steps to help.
If it is possible to create a live example of the problem that you can link to.
