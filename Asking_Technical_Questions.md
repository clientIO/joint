# Asking Technical Questions

*Please review the following guidelines in order to ask the best question possible.*

### 1. Summarize the problem as a title.

Open your question with a title/heading. This is the first thing potential answers will see. Think about your
problem carefully, and then try to summarize the problem in a short and clear manner.

These are some examples of helpful openings for a technical question.

- How can I ... ?
- Is it possible to ... ?
- Are there any ... ?

If you're having trouble summarizing the problem, write the title last - sometimes writing the rest of the question first can make it easier to describe the problem.


### 2. Explain the problem.

Before providing some code examples, explain the problem in more detail in an opening paragraph. This should provide more context to the opening question. 


### 3. Include steps to reproduce problem.

Provide steps to reproduce the issue. Include relevant code examples to allow others to reproduce the issue. You can also add any solutions you have already tried yourself.
