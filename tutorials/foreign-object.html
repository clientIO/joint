            <h1>Foreign Object</h1>

            <p>
                In the wonderful world of SVG elements, 
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/foreignObject" target="_blank">foreignObject</a> stands 
                out from the rest as it provides some unique behaviour that other SVG elements do not. SVG, like other XML dialects, is namespaced. 
                That means if you want to include elements from a different XML namespace right in your SVG, you need some mechanism to enable this 
                functionality. That's where foreignObject comes into play.
            </p>

            <p>
                How does this relate to creating diagrams with JointJS? While JointJS provides a lot of functionality and customization for users,
                we as developers are a habitual bunch. If we want to create some basic interactive elements, we often want to reach for technologies
                we are already familiar with, and in Web land, the dominant force in this regard is still good old HTML.
            </p>

            <p>
                Historically, recommending foreignObject to users of JointJS was a little bit tricky, the main reason for this was the inherent lack of 
                support for foreignObject in Internet Explorer. Hence, the difficulty in integrating support into the library due to the requirement of 
                supporting all users, including the users who were still using IE. Luckily for us, the days in which we had to support IE are now at an end, 
                and all other major browsers have full support which can be seen in the following 
                <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=foreignObject" target="_blank">caniuse</a> reference table.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now that we can confidently recommend the use of foreignObject with JointJS, users can now enjoy the benefits of HTML in their diagrams. 
                Embedding HTML text in SVG, creating basic interactive elements like buttons, or working with HTML inputs should now be a more 
                straightforward process. With this addition, combining the power of JointJS with foreignObject opens up a world of possibilities 
                for interactivity within your JointJS diagrams.
            </p>

            <p>
                In order to get a general idea of how the foreignObject element can be utilized, let's get started with a simple example without JointJS.
            </p>

            <h3>foreignObject</h3>

            <p>
                In the following example, <code>foreignObject</code> is placed within our SVG tag. Note, that it's mandatory in this instance to include the XHTML 
                namespace on the <code>div</code> element. This example creates a simple SVG rect element with some HTML text. 
            </p>

            <pre><code>&lt;svg version="1.1" width="300" height="200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
        div {
            color: white;
            font: 16px sans-serif;
        }

        p {
            margin: 0;
        }
    &lt;/style&gt;
    &lt;rect x="0", width="180" height="100" rx="5" ry="5" fill="#4b5d67" /&gt;
    &lt;foreignObject x="10" y="10" width="160" height="80"&gt;
        &lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
            &lt;p style="padding: 5px">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/foreignObject&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;
</code></pre>

        <p>
            Now that we have an idea of what foreignObject is all about. How would we create an equivalent example in JointJS?
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>
            We believe foreignObject support is a big step forward for JointJS. It will allow our users to create even more 
            innovative and interactive diagramming solutions, and we can't wait to see what they create.
