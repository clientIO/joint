    <title>JointJS - Create custom attributes with prop() and set()</title>

    <h2>Custom Attributes</h2>

    <p>
        If you have been working with JointJS for any amount of time, you are probably familiar with presentation Attributes.
        These are the attributes which contribute to the visual aspect of our shape. While presentation Attributes provide
        us with great functionality, occasionally we might want to create our own attributes to help us work with our shape.
        This is where custom attributes come in useful. Maybe we want a boolean to represent a state, a number for our threshold
        value, or just provide some attributes which represent our specific problem, all of these could be possible use cases 
        for a custom attribute.
    </p>

    <h3>set()</h3>
    <h3>prop()</h3>
    <h3>Why don't we just use attr()?</h3>

    <p>
        That's all we will cover in this tutorial. Thanks for staying with us if you got this far. If you would like 
        to explore any of the features mentioned here in more detail, you can find extra information in our
