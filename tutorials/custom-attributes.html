    <title>JointJS - Create custom attributes with prop() and set()</title>

    <h2>Custom Attributes</h2>

    <p>
        If you have been working with JointJS for any amount of time, you are probably familiar with presentation Attributes.
        These are the attributes which contribute to the visual aspect of our shape, and are mostly defined through
        <code>attrs</code> objects. While presentation Attributes provide us with great functionality, occasionally we might want 
        to create our own attributes to help us work with our shape. This is where custom attributes come in useful. Maybe we 
        want a boolean to represent a state, a number for our threshold value, or just provide some attributes which represent our 
        specific problem, all of these could be possible use cases for a custom attribute.
    </p>

    <p>To store custom data on our model, we use <code>prop()</code> and <code>set()</code> methods</p>.

    <h3>prop()</h3>

    <p>
        <!-- Allows possible nesting if needed -->
        Prop is used to set custom data attributes on the element model. Not only will it allow you set properties directly, it also
        provides support for nesting making it very flexible.
    </p>

    <pre><code>
        element.prop('data/count', 10);
    </code></pre>

    <h3>set()</h3>

    <p>
        Set is provided by <i>backbone.js</i>, and similarly to <code>prop()</code>, it is used to set custom data attributes on the element model. 
        <!-- Not suited to nested properties like prop()?? -->
    </p>

    <pre><code>
        element.set('confirmed', true);
    </code></pre>



    <h3>Differences between set() and prop()</h3>

    <h3>Why don't we just use attr()?</h3>

    <p>
        As mentioned before, the <code>attr()</code> method is primarily used for presentation attributes. These are attributes
        which appear in an attrs object. Custom attributes will appear as a sibling to the <code>attrs</code> object. This provides 
        a nice separation between visual attributes and our custom attributes. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <!-- Briefly explain attrs object -->
        <code>attr()</code> assigns SVG attributes directly to markup of SVGElements.
    </p>
