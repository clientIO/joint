            <h2>Multiple links between elements</h2>

            <p>You've been asking how to deal with a situation when two or more links connect the same elements, they are
                covering each other and therefore it's quite hard to interact with them. The solution introduced in this
                tutorial shows a function that automatically creates vertices so that they cross control points in a way
                that makes the links shape a cluster with gaps between them. JointJS has a built-in 
                <a href="http://www.daviddurman.com/hidden-gold-of-jointjs-the-geometry-library.html" target="_blank">geometry
                library</a> that we can use to find those control points.</p>

            <p>The core of the solution is wrapped in one function named <code>adjustVertices</code>. It accepts a <code>graph</code>
                and a <code>cell</code> (either link or element). If the <code>cell</code> is a link, it will find all links
                with the same source and target and then set vertices on them. We'll be calling those links 'siblings'. If
                the <code>cell</code> is an element, we execute our function for each distinct (in terms of its source and
                target) connected link to the element.</p> To make the usage even more comfortable, we allow passing model
            views as well. Ok, this is the function.

            <pre data-src="js/adjust-vertices.js" style="height: 1650px"></pre>

            <p>Now we have to figure out when to call our function. Vertices need to be adjusted any time user changes the
                source or target of a link or he adds/removes one. Additionally we might want to recalculate the vertices
                when user translates an element.</p>

            <pre data-src="js/bind-adjust-vertices.js" style="height: 200px"></pre>

            <p>Well, that's it. We can take a look at the result.</p>


            <p>
                <small>Try to move an element to see how the links follow. Then try to reconnect a link by dragging its
                    arrowhead to see how the links shape a cluster.
