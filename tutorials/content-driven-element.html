            <h2>Content Driven Elements</h2>

            <p>
                JointJS provides a lot of flexibility when it comes to creating custom elements. In the following tutorial, we won't
                focus on traditional JointJS mechanisms such as markup and attributes, but on elements driven by the content itself. 
            <p>
            
            <p>
                There is no limit to what type of content can drive element dimensions, but in our example we will focus on some of 
                the more common ones such as text and images.
            </p>

            <p>
                Depending on your use case, you may not need a content driven element, so a valid question might be, why use one when 
                we already have well established methods for creating custom elements?
            </p>

            <p>
                Imagine working with a dataset with many data points. What if each data point has a a label of different length, and 
                you want to make sure the label doesn't extend beyond its element bounds? In this instance, it might not be desirable 
                to set the element's size in retrospect, and it might be a more efficient workflow to allow the label content to drive 
                element sizing instead.
            </p>
