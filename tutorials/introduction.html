            <h2>About JointJS</h2>

            <p><strong>The JointJS diagramming library</strong> lets you create fully interactive diagramming tools for all
                modern browsers, relying only on JavaScript and
                <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/IG/resources/svgprimer.html" target="_blank">SVG</a>.
                Its MVC (more MV) architecture separates graph, element and link models from their rendering, which
                makes it easy to plug JointJS to your backend application.
                JointJS is not trying to reinvent the wheel for technologies that are commonly used by web
                developers; things that you learn with JointJS will be useful to you elsewhere.
                JointJS is built with <a href="http://backbonejs.org" target="_blank">Backbone</a> MVC
                library and makes use of <a href="http://jquery.com" target="_blank">jQuery</a> and
                <a href="https://lodash.com" target="_blank">Lodash</a>.</p>

            <p>A diagram in JointJS is represented by a Graph model (<code>joint.dia.Graph</code>) to which you add
                models of cells - either Elements (subtypes of <code>joint.dia.Element</code>) or Links (subtypes of
                <code>joint.dia.Link</code>).
                To present the diagram, attach it to a Paper view (<code>joint.dia.Paper</code>).
                Starting from version 0.6, you manipulate models, not views; the paper generates ElementViews and
                LinkViews for you from the data provided by the graph models.
                The architecture is illustrated in the following diagram (created with JointJS!).</p>

            <p>JointJS provides a visual library of common geometric shapes, as well as an extensive collection of
                ready-to-use components from several well-known diagramming languages (ERD, OrgChart, FSA, UML,
                PN, DEVS, ...).
                The JointJS framework has been designed with an eye towards modularity.
                This makes it easy for advanced users to create their own shapes and to extend built-in functionality
                with custom plugins.
                <a href="https://www.jointjs.com">Rappid</a>, a commercial extension to JointJS, provides a number of
                pre-made plugins that extend its functionality with widgets, interaction components, and
                additional shapes (BPMN diagrams).</p>
