# joint-plus-tutorial-react

This git repository is intended for instructional purposes. It is the source code that accompanies a JointJS+ blog post "Integration with React" which can be found [here](https://resources.jointjs.com/tutorial/react-ts).

### Prerequisites

To run the following code, you will need a [JointJS+ license](https://www.jointjs.com/license) that comes with the JointJS+ installable package file `joint-plus.tgz`.

### Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- git

#### Setup

Clone this repository.

```
git clone git@github.com:clientIO/joint-plus-tutorial-react.git
```

Change into the `joint-plus-tutorial-react` directory.

```
cd joint-plus-tutorial-react
```

For this tutorial, you need to place your own `joint-plus.tgz` file in the root directory.

When that is completed, you can install the dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Your demo is now ready to start.

```
npm start
```

You should be able to view the demo at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Note
We have decided to keep the React import in our code for consistency reasons.

*Because the new JSX transform will automatically import the necessary react/jsx-runtime functions, React will no longer need to be in scope when you use JSX. This might lead to unused React imports in your code. It doesnâ€™t hurt to keep them.*
