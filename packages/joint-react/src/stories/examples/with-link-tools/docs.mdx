# Link Tools Example

This example shows how to use link tools in your project. Link tools are interactive features that let you edit and manipulate links in a diagram. They make it easy to customize and work with links visually. For more information, check out the [Link Tools documentation](https://resources.jointjs.com/tutorial/link-tools).

You can also use the `jsx` utility provided by JointJS to convert JSX into JointJS markup. This makes it simpler to define custom elements and tools.

### Demo

Here is a live demo of the link tools in action:

<Canvas of={Stories.Default} />

### Code

Below is the code used in this example. You can copy and modify it to fit your needs:

<Markdown>
{`\`\`\`tsx
${Code}
\`\`\``}
</Markdown>
