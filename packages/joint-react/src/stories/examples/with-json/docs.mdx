# Example: Rendering with JSON
This example demonstrates how to render a graph using JSON data. The graph structure, including its elements and connections, is defined in JSON format and then loaded into the `GraphProvider` component.

### Demo
Below is a live demo of the graph rendered from JSON data:
<Canvas of={Stories.Default} />

### Code
The graph is created by parsing JSON data and rendering it within the `GraphProvider` component. This approach allows you to define and manage graph structures programmatically.
