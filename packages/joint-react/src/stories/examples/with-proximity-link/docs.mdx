# Proximity Link Example

This example demonstrates how to create links between nodes based on their `proximity`. When you move the nodes around, links will be dynamically added or removed depending on how close the nodes are to each other.

### Demo

Below is an interactive demo. Try moving the nodes to see how the `proximity-based` links are created and removed dynamically.

<Canvas of={Stories.Default} />

### Code

Here is the code used in this example. You can use it as a reference to implement similar functionality in your own projects.
