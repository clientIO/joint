# Example: Rendering with a Minimap
The minimap uses a second `Paper` to render a scaled-down view of the graph. Internally it wraps the [JointJS Paper](https://docs.jointjs.com/learn/quickstart/paper) and syncs position/scale with the main view.

### Demo
Below is a live demo of the minimap in action:

<Canvas of={Stories.Default} />

### Code
The minimap is implemented as a separate `Paper` and is rendered inside the `GraphProvider` component. It uses properties like `scale` and `interactive` to synchronize and lock interactions.
