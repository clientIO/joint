# MeasuredNode Component
Measured node component automatically detects the size of its `children` and 
updates the graph element (`node`) **width and height** automatically when elements resize.
It must be used inside `renderElement` context - inside `Paper` component.

### Measuring div with exact size defined in the div style.
<Canvas of={Stories.DivWithExactSize} />

### Measuring div with padding and text inside (without explicit size).
<Canvas of={Stories.DivWithPaddingAndText} />

It support also `onSetSize` callback that can be used to update the size of the node (it turn off default functionality to change the size of the node).
