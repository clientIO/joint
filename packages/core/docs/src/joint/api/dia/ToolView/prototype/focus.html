<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>toolView.focus()</code></pre>
<p>Focus the tool within its containing <code>toolsView</code>.</p>

<p>When a tool is <q>focused</q>, all other tools within the <code>toolsView</code> are hidden and the tool's opacity is changed according to the tool's <code>focusOpacity</code> option. Only one tool can be focused at a time; the focus passes to the last tool within a tools view on which the <code>focus</code> function was called.</p>

<p>The effect of this function can be reversed by the <code>toolView.blur</code> <a href="#dia.ToolView.prototype.blur">function</a>.</p>
