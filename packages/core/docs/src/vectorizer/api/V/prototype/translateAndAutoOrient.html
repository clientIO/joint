        <p>Auto-orient the element. This basically implements the <code>orient=auto</code> attribute of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/marker">markers</a>. The easiest way of understanding on what this does is to imagine the element is an arrowhead. Calling this method on the arrowhead makes it point to the <code>position</code> point while being auto-oriented (properly rotated) towards the <code>reference</code> point. <code>target</code> is the element relative to which the transformations are applied. Usually the root SVG element which is also default if not <code>target</code> is passed.</p>
