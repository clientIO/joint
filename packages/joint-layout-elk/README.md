# JointJS ELK Layout

A module for automatic layout of *[JointJS](https://www.jointjs.com)* graphs using the [Eclipse Layout Kernel (ELK)](https://www.eclipse.org/elk/), via its JavaScript port [elkjs](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs).

This library depends on [JointJS](https://github.com/clientio/joint) (*>=4.0*), so please read its `README.md` before using this library.

`layout()` is a one-off, asynchronous transform: it builds an ELK graph from a JointJS graph (embedded elements become nested containers at any depth, ports and link labels are included), runs ELK's layout algorithm, and writes the result (positions, sizes, link vertices/anchors, label positions) back onto the graph. It does not keep the graph laid out afterwards - call it again after further changes.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install @joint/layout-elk
```

### Basic Usage

```ts
import { dia, shapes } from '@joint/core';
import { layout } from '@joint/layout-elk';

const graph = new dia.Graph({}, { cellNamespace: shapes });
const paper = new dia.Paper({
    model: graph,
    cellViewNamespace: shapes,
    el: document.getElementById('paper'),
});

const rect1 = new shapes.standard.Rectangle({ id: 'a', size: { width: 80, height: 40 }, attrs: { label: { text: 'A' }}});
const rect2 = new shapes.standard.Rectangle({ id: 'b', size: { width: 80, height: 40 }, attrs: { label: { text: 'B' }}});
const link = new shapes.standard.Link({ source: { id: 'a' }, target: { id: 'b' }});

graph.addCells([rect1, rect2, link]);

const { bbox } = await layout({ graph }, {
    elkLayoutOptions: {
        'elk.algorithm': 'layered',
        'elk.direction': 'RIGHT',
        'elk.edgeRouting': 'ORTHOGONAL'
    }
});
```

## 📖 API Reference

### `layout({ graph, elements?, links? }, options?): Promise<LayoutResult>`

- `graph`: `dia.Graph` - the graph to lay out (also where the layout's batch runs).
- `elements?`: `dia.Element[]` - which of its elements to lay out. Default: all of the graph's elements.
- `links?`: `dia.Link[]` - which of its links to lay out. Default: all of the graph's links.
- `options?`: `LayoutOptions` - layout configuration (see below).

`elements` and `links` are both the selection and the order:

- **Selection** - only the given elements are laid out, and a given link only if both its ends are laid out too. Everything else is left untouched. An element whose parent isn't in `elements` is laid out as a top-level element.
- **Order** - the top-level elements follow the order of `elements`, and so do each container's given children (instead of `getEmbeddedCells()` order). The links follow the order of `links`, inside each container too.
- Each cell must appear only once in its list. An empty `elements` lays out nothing.

```ts
// Lay out only the selected elements, and every link between them.
await layout({ graph, elements: selectedElements });
```

```ts
interface LayoutResult {
    bbox: g.Rect;      // Tight bounding box of the laid out graph
    elkGraph: ElkNode;  // The raw ELK layout result (e.g. for junction points)
}
```

### `LayoutOptions`

```ts
interface LayoutOptions {
    // The ELK instance to lay out with, e.g. one running in a Web Worker (see `createWorkerElk()` below).
    elk?: WorkerElk | ELK; // Default: a shared instance running on the main thread
    // ELK layout options, passed through to ELK unmodified.
    elkLayoutOptions?: ElkLayoutOptions; // Default: { 'elk.algorithm': 'layered', 'elk.hierarchyHandling': 'INCLUDE_CHILDREN', 'elk.json.edgeCoords': 'ROOT' }
    // A name for the layout batch, grouping everything `layout()` applies into one graph change.
    batchName?: string; // Default: 'layout'
    // Aborts the layout - `layout()` rejects with the signal's reason and applies nothing.
    signal?: AbortSignal;

    // Export callbacks (JointJS graph -> ELK graph) - see below.
    exportElement?: ExportElementCallback;
    exportPort?: ExportPortCallback;
    exportPortLabel?: ExportPortLabelCallback;
    exportLink?: ExportLinkCallback;
    exportLinkLabel?: ExportLinkLabelCallback;

    // Import callbacks (ELK layout result -> JointJS graph) - see below.
    setElementAttributes?: SetElementAttributesCallback;
    setPortAttributes?: SetPortAttributesCallback;
    setLinkAttributes?: SetLinkAttributesCallback;
}
```

### Export callbacks

Each receives an ELK draft already populated with what this package computed for that element/port/link/label, to mutate in place (e.g. to set `elk.*` `layoutOptions`). Returning `false` instead drops it from the ELK graph entirely - for `exportElement`, its whole subtree (embeds, ports, any connected edge) goes with it.

```ts
type ExportElementCallback = (params: { element: dia.Element; elkNode: ElkNodeDraft }) => void | false;
type ExportPortCallback = (params: { portId: string; element: dia.Element; elkPort: ElkPortDraft }) => void | false;
type ExportPortLabelCallback = (params: { portId: string; element: dia.Element; elkPortLabel: ElkLabelDraft }) => void | false;
type ExportLinkCallback = (params: { link: dia.Link; elkEdge: ElkEdgeDraft }) => void | false;
type ExportLinkLabelCallback = (params: { link: dia.Link; labelIndex: number; elkEdgeLabel: ElkLabelDraft }) => void | false;
```

### Import callbacks

Each applies the ELK-computed attributes itself, in place of the package's own default (`element.set(...)`/`element.portProp(...)`/`link.set(...)`) - use one to redirect where the result goes, e.g. into a `transition()`.

```ts
type SetElementAttributesCallback = (params: { element: dia.Element; attributes: { position: dia.Point; size?: dia.Size }; elkNode: ElkNode }) => void;
type SetPortAttributesCallback = (params: { element: dia.Element; portId: string; attributes: { position: { args: dia.Point }; label?: { position: { args: dia.Point } } }; elkPort: ElkPort }) => void;
type SetLinkAttributesCallback = (params: { link: dia.Link; attributes: { vertices: dia.Point[]; source?: dia.Link.EndJSON; target?: dia.Link.EndJSON; labels?: dia.Link.Label[] }; elkEdge: ElkExtendedEdge }) => void;
```

### Running ELK in a Web Worker

By default, `layout()` runs ELK on the main thread - nothing to set up, and it works anywhere (browsers, Node/SSR, tests, the UMD build). ELK blocks the page while it runs, though: a few milliseconds for a small graph, but up to seconds for one with thousands of elements. To keep the page responsive, run ELK in a Web Worker instead - start one with `createWorkerElk()` and pass it to `layout()` as `elk`:

```ts
import { layout, createWorkerElk } from '@joint/layout-elk';

const elk = createWorkerElk(() => new Worker(new URL('@joint/layout-elk/worker', import.meta.url), { type: 'module' }));

await layout({ graph }, { elk });

// Once no longer needed.
elk.terminate();
```

#### `createWorkerElk(createWorker: () => Worker): WorkerElk`

`createWorker` starts the worker - running `@joint/layout-elk/worker`, the package's worker script (ELK's own, `elkjs/lib/elk-worker.min.js`). Starting it is up to you, since only your bundler knows where the script ends up:

- **webpack 5, Vite** (dev server and builds) - `new Worker(new URL('@joint/layout-elk/worker', import.meta.url), { type: 'module' })`, as above. Both bundle the worker script as a file of its own. With webpack, keep `output.publicPath` at `'auto'` (the default), so the file is found wherever the app is served from.
- **Vite** - also `import ElkWorker from '@joint/layout-elk/worker?worker'`, then `createWorkerElk(() => new ElkWorker())`.
- **No bundler** (e.g. the UMD build) - serve a copy of `elkjs/lib/elk-worker.min.js`, then `createWorkerElk(() => new Worker('/path/to/elk-worker.min.js'))`.

The returned `WorkerElk`:

- **Starts the worker on its first layout**, then lays out every graph in it, one at a time - share one instance between layouts.
- **Stops an aborted layout** (see `signal` below) by terminating the worker, if it is busy with it - a new worker takes over the layouts still waiting.
- **Rejects the layout the worker crashes during** (e.g. out of memory) - a new worker takes over the layouts still waiting.
- **Rejects every layout when the worker fails to load** (e.g. its script isn't served where `createWorker` starts it from) or can't be started (e.g. a CSP `worker-src` that blocks it) - with an error saying so, rather than running ELK on the main thread. The next layout tries again with a new worker.
- **`terminate()`** terminates the worker - layouts not settled yet are rejected, and a later layout starts a new worker.

Any other ELK instance works as `elk` too, e.g. `elkjs`'s own `new ELK({ workerUrl })` (`elkjs/lib/elk-api.js`) - without stopping an aborted layout, though (see below).

### Aborting a layout

`layout()` is asynchronous, so the graph may change while ELK is still computing - pass an `AbortSignal` to drop a layout that is no longer wanted (or takes too long). An aborted `layout()` rejects with the signal's reason (an `AbortError` `DOMException` by default) and applies nothing to the graph.

```ts
let controller: AbortController | undefined;

async function runLayout() {
    // Only the latest layout is applied.
    controller?.abort();
    controller = new AbortController();
    try {
        await layout({ graph }, { signal: controller.signal });
    } catch (error) {
        if ((error as Error).name !== 'AbortError') throw error;
    }
}

// Give up after 5 seconds.
await layout({ graph }, { signal: AbortSignal.timeout(5000) });
```

ELK can't stop a layout in progress, so a layout a `createWorkerElk()` worker is busy with is stopped by terminating the worker - a new one takes over the layouts still waiting. A layout on the main thread, or in any other `elk` instance, keeps running - only its result is ignored.

## ⚠️ Caveats & Known Limitations

- **Edge coordinates are graph-absolute** - `layout()` sets `elk.json.edgeCoords: 'ROOT'`, so ELK returns every edge's route points and labels relative to the root, whichever container the edge is in, and the default import applies them as they are. Overriding it (e.g. `'CONTAINER'`) is allowed, but the default import then misplaces vertices, end anchors and labels of edges inside containers - convert them yourself in `setLinkAttributes` (from `elkEdge`). The same applies to the raw `elkGraph` in `layout()`'s result.
- **Node labels are not supported** - ELK's node-label placement assumes labels are layout participants, whereas JointJS labels are attrs inside the shape. Link labels are supported.
- **Ports keep their JointJS-computed position by default** - every element with ports is exported with `elk.portConstraints: 'FIXED_POS'`, so ELK keeps each port where the element's port groups place it and edges route to/from that exact spot. Opt into ELK repositioning/reordering them by overriding it (e.g. `'FIXED_SIDE'`/`'FREE'`) in `exportElement` - setting it in `elkLayoutOptions` has no effect, since the per-node value takes precedence.
- **Asynchronous** - unlike `@joint/layout-directed-graph`, `layout()` returns a `Promise`, since `elkjs` computes layouts asynchronously - even on the main thread.
- **Main thread by default** - without an `elk` option, ELK runs on the main thread and blocks the page while it runs - see "Running ELK in a Web Worker" above. The main-thread copy of ELK (`elkjs/lib/elk.bundled.js`) is imported dynamically, so bundlers split it into a chunk of its own, only loaded by the first layout without an `elk` option.

An application that bundles this package does ship `elkjs` code though (the main-thread chunk, and the Web Worker file if it uses `@joint/layout-elk/worker`), under that license: keep `elkjs`'s license notice with it (e.g. with your bundler's license extraction), and note where its source is available (it is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elkjs)).
