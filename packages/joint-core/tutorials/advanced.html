            <h1>Advanced Tutorial</h1>

            <p>By now, you should be familiar with the <a href="hello-world.html">basics of JointJS</a>, as well as with
                some <a href="intermediate.html">intermediate-difficulty topics</a>.</p>

            <p>The advanced section of the tutorial delves into much more detail about the topics mentioned in the
                basic and intermediate sections of the tutorial.
                Expect this section to grow in the future; we add advanced new features to JointJS regularly, and most
                of them will be introduced in this section.
                The current list of advanced topics can be found in the sidebar of this page.</p>
