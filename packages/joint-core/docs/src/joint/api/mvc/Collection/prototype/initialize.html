<p>
    When creating a Collection, you may choose to pass in the initial array of models. The collection's 
    <a href="#mvc.Collection.prototype.comparator"><code>comparator</code></a> may be included as an option. Passing <code>false</code> as the 
    <code>comparator</code> option will prevent sorting. If you define an initialize function, it will be invoked when the collection is created.
    Initialize is an empty function by default. Override it with your own initialization logic.
</p>

<p>
    There are a couple of options that, if provided, are attached to the collection directly: <code>model</code> and <code>comparator</code>. 
    Pass <code>null</code> for models to create an empty Collection with <code>options</code>. 
</p>

<pre><code>const shapes = new mvc.Collection(null, {
    model: Shape
});
</code></pre>
