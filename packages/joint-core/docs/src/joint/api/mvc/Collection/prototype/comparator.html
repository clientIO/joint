<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>collection.comparator</code></pre>

<p>
    By default there is no comparator for a collection. If you define a comparator, it will be used to sort the collection any time a model is 
    added. A comparator can be defined as a <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#sortBy" target="_blank"><code>sortBy</code></a> (pass a function 
    that takes a single argument), as a 
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort" target="_blank"><code>sort</code></a> 
    (pass a comparator function that expects two arguments), or as a string indicating the attribute to sort by. 
</p>

<p>
    "sortBy" comparator functions take a model and return a numeric or string value by which the model should be ordered relative to others. 
    "sort" comparator functions take two models, and return <code>-1</code> if the first model should come before the second, <code>0</code> if 
    they are of the same rank and <code>1</code> if the first model should come after. Note that JointJS depends on the arity of your comparator 
    function to determine between the two styles, so be careful if your comparator function is bound.
</p>

<pre><code>const Shape = new mvc.Model;
const shapes = new mvc.Collection;

shapes.comparator = 'order';

shapes.add(new Shape({ order: 3, letter: "C" }));
shapes.add(new Shape({ order: 2, letter: "B" }));
shapes.add(new Shape({ order: 1, letter: "A" }));

console.log(shapes.pluck('letter')); // A, B, C
</code></pre>

<p>
    Note: Collections with a comparator will not automatically re-sort if you later change model attributes, so you may wish to call 
    <code>sort</code> after changing model attributes that would affect the order.
