    For use with collections as ES classes. If you define a <code>preinitialize</code> method, it will be invoked when the Collection is first 
    created and before any instantiation logic is run for the Collection.

<pre><code>class Shapes extends mvc.Collection {
    preinitialize() {
      this.on('add', function() {
        console.log('Add model event got fired!');
      });
    }
} 
</code></pre>
