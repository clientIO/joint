<p>
    Collections are ordered sets of models. You can bind <code>"change"</code> events to be notified when any model in the collection has been 
    modified, and listen for <code>"add"</code> and <code>"remove"</code> events.
</p>

<p>
    Any event that is triggered on a model in a collection will also be triggered on the collection directly, for convenience. This allows you to 
    listen for changes to specific attributes in any model in a collection.
