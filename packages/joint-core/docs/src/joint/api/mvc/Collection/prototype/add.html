<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>collection.add(models, [options])</code></pre>

<p>
    Add a model (or an array of models) to the collection, firing an <code>"add"</code> event for each model, and an <code>"update"</code> event 
    afterwards. This is a variant of <a href="#mvc.Collection.prototype.set"><code>set()</code></a> with the same options and return value, but it 
    always adds and never removes. If you're adding models to the collection that are already in the collection, they'll be ignored, unless you 
    pass <code>{ merge: true }</code>, in which case their attributes will be merged into the corresponding models, firing any appropriate 
    <code>"change"</code> events. 
</p>

<pre><code>const shapes = new mvc.Collection;

shapes.on('add', function(shape) {
  console.log(shape.get('name'));
  // A
  // B
});

shapes.add([
  { name: 'A' },
  { name: 'B' }
]);
</code></pre>

<p>
  Note that adding the same model (a model with the same <code>id</code>) to a collection more than once is a no-op. 
</p>
