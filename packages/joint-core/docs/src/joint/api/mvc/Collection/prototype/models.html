<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>collection.models</code></pre>

<p>
    Raw access to the JavaScript array of models inside of the collection. Usually you'll want to use <code>get()</code> or <code>at()</code> to 
    access model objects, but occasionally a direct reference to the array is desired.
