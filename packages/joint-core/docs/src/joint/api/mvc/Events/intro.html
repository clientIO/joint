<p>
    A module that can be mixed in to any object in order to provide it with a custom event channel. You may bind a callback to an event with
    <code>on</code> or remove with <code>off</code>; <code>trigger</code>-ing an event fires all callbacks in succession. Events do not have to be 
    declared before they are bound, and may take passed arguments.
</p>

<pre><code>const object = {};
joint.util.assign(object, joint.mvc.Events);
object.on('expand', function(msg){ alert('expanded' + msg); });
object.trigger('expand', 'the example');
</code></pre>
