<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>object.once(event, callback, [context])</code></pre>

<p>
    Just like <code>on</code>, but causes the bound callback to fire only once before being removed.  When multiple events are passed in using the 
    space separated syntax, the event will fire once for every event you passed in, not once for a combination of all events.
