<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>view.$(selector)</code></pre>

<p>
    If jQuery is included on the page, each view has a <code>$</code> function that runs queries scoped within the view's element. If you use 
    this scoped jQuery function, you don't have to use model ids as part of your query to pull out specific elements in a list, and can rely much 
    more on HTML class attributes. It's equivalent to running: <code>view.$el.find(selector)</code>
