    A View is simply a JavaScript object that represents a logical chunk of UI in the DOM. The general idea is to organize your interface into
    logical views, backed by models, each of which can be updated independently when the model changes, without having to redraw the page.
    This allows you to bind your view's <code>render</code> function to the model's <code>"change"</code> event â€” and now everywhere that model 
    data is displayed in the UI, it is always immediately up to date.
