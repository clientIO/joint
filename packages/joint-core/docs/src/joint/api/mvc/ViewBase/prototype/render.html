<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>view.render()</code></pre>

<p>
    <code>render</code> is the core function that your view should override, in order to populate its element (<code>this.el</code>), 
    with the appropriate HTML. The convention is for render to always return <code>this</code> to enable chained calls.
