<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>view.el</code></pre>

<p>
    All views have a DOM element at all times (the <code>el</code> property), whether they've already been inserted into the page or not.
    In this fashion, views can be rendered at any time, and inserted into the DOM all at once, in order to get high-performance UI rendering with
    as few reflows and repaints as possible.
</p>

<p>
    <code>this.el</code> can be resolved from a DOM selector string or an Element; otherwise it will be created from the view's
    <code>tagName</code>, <code>className</code>, <code>id</code> and <code>attributes</code> properties. If none are set, <code>this.el</code>
    is an empty <code>div</code>, which is often just fine. An <code>el</code> reference may also be passed in to the view's constructor.
</p>

<pre><code>const ShapeView = mvc.View.extend({
    el: 'body'
});

const shape = new ShapeView();
console.log(shape.el) // &lt;body&gt;...&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>
