    There are several special options that, if passed, will be attached directly to the view: <code>model</code>, <code>collection</code>,
    <code>el</code>, <code>id</code>, <code>className</code>, <code>tagName</code>, <code>attributes</code> and <code>events</code>.
    If the view defines an <code>initialize</code> function, it will be called when the view is first created. Initialize is an empty function by
    default. Override it with your own initialization logic.

    If you'd like to create a view that references an element already in the DOM, pass in the element as an option:
    <code>new View({ el: existingElement })</code>
</p>
