<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>model.defaults or model.defaults()</code></pre>

<p>
    The defaults hash (or function) can be used to specify the default attributes for your model. When creating an instance of the model, any 
    unspecified attributes will be set to their default value. 
</p>

<p>
    Remember that in JavaScript, objects are passed by reference, so if you include an object as a default value, it will be shared among all 
    instances. Instead, define defaults as a function.
