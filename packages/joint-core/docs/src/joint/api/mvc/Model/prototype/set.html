<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>model.set(attribute)</code></pre>

<p>
    Set a hash of attributes (one or many) on the model. If any of the attributes change the model's state, a <code>"change"</code> event will be 
    triggered on the model. <code>set()</code> doesn't provide nesting capability in the form of a string. That means any path representation is 
    considered to be one attribute.
