<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>model.changed</code></pre>

<p>
    The changed property is the internal hash containing all the <code>attributes</code> that have changed since its last 
    <a href="#mvc.Model.prototype.set"><code>set()</code></a>. Please do not update changed directly since its state is internally maintained by 
    <code>set()</code>. A copy of changed can be acquired from <a href="#mvc.Model.prototype.changedAttributes"><code>changedAttributes</code></a>.
