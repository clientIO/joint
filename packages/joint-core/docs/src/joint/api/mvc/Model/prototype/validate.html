<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>model.validate(attributes, options)</code></pre>

<p>
    This method is left undefined and you're encouraged to override it with any custom validation logic you have that can be performed in 
    JavaScript. If the <code>attributes</code> are valid, don't return anything from <code>validate</code>; if they are invalid return an error 
    of your choosing. It can be as simple as a string error message to be displayed, or a complete error object that describes the error 
    programmatically. 
</p>

<p>
    It's possible to tell <code>set()</code> to validate the new attributes by passing <code>{ validate: true }</code> as an option. The validate 
    method receives the model attributes as well as any options passed to <code>set()</code>. <code>"invalid"</code> events are useful for 
    providing coarse-grained error messages at the model or collection level.
