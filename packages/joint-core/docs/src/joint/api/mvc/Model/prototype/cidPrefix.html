<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>model.cidPrefix</code></pre>

<p>
    If your model has an <code>id</code> that is anything other than an integer or a UUID, there is the possibility that it might collide with its 
    <code>cid</code>. To prevent this, you can override the prefix that <code>cids</code> start with.
