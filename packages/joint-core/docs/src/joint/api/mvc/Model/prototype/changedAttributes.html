<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>model.changedAttributes([attributes])</code></pre>

<p>
    Retrieve a hash of only the model's attributes that have changed since the last <a href="#mvc.Model.prototype.set"><code>set()</code></a>, or 
    <code>false</code> if there are none. Optionally, an external <code>attributes</code> hash can be passed in, returning the attributes in 
    that hash which differ from the model. This can be used to figure out which portions of a view should be updated.
