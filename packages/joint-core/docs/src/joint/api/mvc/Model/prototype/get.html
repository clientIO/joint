<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>model.get(attribute)</code></pre>

<p>
    Get the current value of an attribute from the model. For example: <code>model.get("title")</code>. <code>get()</code> doesn't provide nesting 
    capability in the form of a string. That means any path representation is considered to be one attribute.
