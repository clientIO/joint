<code>connectorNamespace</code> - built-in <a href="#connectors">connectors</a> are defined by default on the <code>joint.connectors</code> namespace. 
                                It is also possible to define custom connectors on this namespace. If you would like JointJS to look for connector
                                definitions under a different namespace, you can set the <code>connectorNamespace</code> option to your desired 
                                namespace.
