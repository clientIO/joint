<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>link.removeAttr(path [, opt])</code></pre>
<p>Remove a previously set attribute from the link. <code>path</code> can either be a string that specifies the path to the (possibly nested) attribute to be removed, or an array of more paths. The associated link view makes sure the link gets re-rendered properly.</p>

<p>If <code>opt</code> is passed, it can contain data that is passed over to the event listeners for the <code>change:attrs</code> event triggered on the link itself and also on the graph the link is in.</p>
