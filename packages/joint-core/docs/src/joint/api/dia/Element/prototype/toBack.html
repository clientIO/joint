<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>element.toBack([opt])</code></pre>

<p>Move the element so it is behind all other cells (elements/links). If <code>opt.deep</code> is
    <code>true</code>, all the embedded cells of this element will be updated in a Breadth-first
    search (BFS) fashion.
</p>

<p>If <code>opt.foregroundEmbeds</code> is <code>true</code> (as by default), all the embedded
    cells will get a higher <code>z</code> index than that of this element. This is especially useful in hierarchical diagrams where if you want to send an element to the back, you don't want its children (embedded cells) to be hidden behind that element. If
    <code>opt.foregroundEmbeds</code> is <code>false</code>, the original order within the group is preserved, allowing children to remain behind their parents.
</p>

<p>Set <code>opt.breadthFirst</code> to <code>false</code> to index the elements using Depth-first search (DFS).</p>
