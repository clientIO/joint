<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>element.clone(options)</code></pre><p>Returns a new instance of the element with identical attributes. If <code>options.deep === true</code>, then
            all the embedded cells (elements, links) of the element are cloned as well. In this case, the return value is an array of
            instances rather then a single instance.</p>
