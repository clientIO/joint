<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>graph.getSuccessors(element [, opt])</code></pre>
<p>
    Return an array of all the successors of <code>element</code>. 
    By default, a <a href="#dia.Graph.prototype.dfs">Depth-first search algorithm</a> is used (important for the order of returned elements).
</p>

<p>
    If <code>opt.breadthFirst</code> is set to <code>true</code>, use a <a href="#dia.Graph.prototype.bfs">Breadth-first search algorithm</a> 
    instead.
</p>

<p>
    Generally, <code>getSuccessors</code> cares about the direction of the links. It follows links from their source to target only. The 
    resulting array contains the elements that you visit if you follow the directed links. The links are simply navigated, and embedding 
    is not considered.
</p>

<p>
    In the following image, the successors of <code>A</code> are <code>C</code> and <code>B</code>. Embedding is not taken into account.

<p>
    If <code>opt.deep</code> is set to <code>true</code>, embedded elements are taken into account too 
    (see <a href="#dia.Graph.prototype.dfs">dfs()</a> for details). That means elements connected to any of the descendants are also
    successors.
</p>

<p>
    In the following image, if <code>{ deep: false }</code>, the only successor of <code>A</code> is <code>D</code>. Embedding is not
    taken into account. If <code>{ deep: true }</code>, and <code>B</code> is embedded in <code>A</code>, that means the successors of
    <code>A</code> are <code>C</code> and <code>D</code>.
