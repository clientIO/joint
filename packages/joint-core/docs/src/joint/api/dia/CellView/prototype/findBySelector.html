<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>cellView.findBySelector(selector)</code></pre>

<p>The method returns an array of DOM nodes matching the <code>selector</code>.</p>

<p>The method searches for matching sub-elements among the descendants of this <code>this.el</code>. If no such sub-elements are found, an empty array is returned.</p>

<p>The available <code>selectors</code> are defined by the <code>markup</code> <a href="#dia.Cell.markup">attribute of the Cell model</a> from which the CellView was initialized.</p>

<p><i>(Deprecated)</i> If no matching sub-element JSON selector is found then <code>this.el.querySelectorAll(selector)</code> is used to try and find an element through CSS selectors. You may disable this functionality to increase performance by setting <code>useCSSSelectors = false</code> in the global config.</p>
