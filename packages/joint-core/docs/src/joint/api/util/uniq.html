<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>util.uniq(array, [iteratee])</code></pre>
<p>Creates a duplicate-free version of an array, using <a href="https://262.ecma-international.org/7.0/#sec-samevaluezero">SameValueZero</a> for equality comparisons, in which only the first occurrence of each element is kept. The order of result values is determined by the order they occur in the array. In addition this method accepts iteratee which is invoked for each element in array to generate the criterion by which uniqueness is computed. The order of result values is determined by the order they occur in the array. The iteratee is invoked with one argument: <i>(value)</i>.</p>
