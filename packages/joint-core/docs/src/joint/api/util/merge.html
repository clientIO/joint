<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>util.merge(destinationObject, [...sourceObjects], [customizer])</code></pre>
<p>This method is like <code>joint.util.assign</code> except that it recursively merges own and inherited enumerable string keyed properties of source objects into the destination object. Source properties that resolve to undefined are skipped if a destination value exists. Array and plain object properties are merged recursively. Other objects and value types are overridden by assignment. Source objects are applied from left to right. Subsequent sources overwrite property assignments of previous sources. In addition this method accepts a customizer which is invoked to produce the merged values of the destination and source properties. The customizer is invoked with six arguments: <i>(objValue, srcValue, key, object, source, stack)</i></p>
