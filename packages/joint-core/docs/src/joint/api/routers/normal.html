<p>The <code>'normal'</code> router is the default router for links and it is the simplest router. It does not have any options and it does not do anything; it returns the vertices passed to it without modification as the route to be taken.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>link.router('normal');</code></pre>
