<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>polyline.pointAtLength(length)</code></pre>
<p>Return a point on the polyline that lies <code>length</code> away from the beginning of the polyline.</p>

<p>If negative <code>length</code> is provided, the algorithm starts looking from the end of the polyline. If <code>length</code> is higher than the length of the polyline, the closest endpoint is returned instead. If the polyline contains no points, <code>null</code> is returned.</p>
