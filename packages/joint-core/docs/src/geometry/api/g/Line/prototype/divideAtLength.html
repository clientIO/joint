<pre class="docs-method-signature"><code>line.divideAtLength(length)</code></pre>
<p>Divide the line into two lines at the point that lies <code>length</code> away from the beginning of the line.</p>

<p>Returns an array with two new lines without modifying the original line. If negative <code>length</code> is provided, the algorithm starts looking from the end of the curve. If <code>length</code> is higher than line length, the line is divided at the closest line endpoint instead.</p>
